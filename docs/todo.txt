priorities:
	
BUGS:
* clamp for view is setting on camera enter, instead of being clamped to the same normal view angle in first person

IN PROGRESS:
* making enemy for combat CURRENTLY WORKING ON THIS
* add minimap for clarity.  Want to be able to see walls around you and maybe enemy position

DONE:
1. making button that interacts with environment (open door maybe?) DONE kinda
2. make the camera swing from side view to new location (first person, other side, etc.) MOSTLY DONE (doesnt go to first person)
