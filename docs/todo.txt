PRIORITIES IN ORDER:
* collectible power ups (maybe uhhhhhh double jump, dash?, wall cling?, ability to go into first person?, charge attack in first person?)
	IDEA: 1 mobility upgrade, 1 upgrade to help first person perspective, 1 upgrade to increase dps or make firing better
* kill/damage zones (moving spike wall, spike trap, etc) 
* melee enemies
* build out level
* build boss (see 3.x)

NICE TO HAVES:
* fix clamp issue (see 2.x)
* need to figure out enemies pushing you off axis (see 1.x)
* make the camera swing from side view to new location (first person, other side, etc.)

DONE:
1. making button that interacts with environment (open door maybe?) DONE kinda
2. gravity and jumping 
3. making enemy for combat
4. fix the hurtboxes not working for enemy and player for combat
5. add minimap for clarity.  Want to be able to see walls around you and maybe enemy position (kind of done, needs to be better looking and more refined)


NOTES:
1.1 another issue is getting off of the x axis.  This happens when you jump generally. i am trying to hard set my position back to 0 but it doesnt work sometimes
2.1 clamp doesnt work if you move the mouse during camera transition (kind of done with that extra if statement but i should figure out root cause)
2.2 might not be moving mouse during camera transition, might be in addition, but also if you go mouse behind the back and go into first person it breaks clamp
3.1 boss has 3 attacks
	side swipe (needs to move up and down)
	pillar attack (need to move left and right)
	goes in background and makes curtain attack (think dragun pattern)



DISREGARD MAYBE?
Part of the issue for the clamp is it is making a local clamp for the pivot, but because the player is rotating, the local clamp is where the original look at value is.  We need to make sure that the player stays still, or the deg_to_rad function is based on global rotation rather than the rotation of the pivot
